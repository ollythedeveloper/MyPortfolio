              <h2>Hello! I'm Olivia Lewis.</h2> 
              <h3>(<i>aka</i> <strong>Olly-the-Developer</strong>)</h3>
              <p>I'm a Fullstack Developer based in Charlotte, NC.</p><p>I became a Biomedical Technician through the United States Army. After doing that for 6+ years, I decided I wanted a career that would combine my technical side with my creative side. That's when I discovered Software Engineering.</p>
             <p>Now I'm a student at <strong>Thinkful</strong>, and couldn't be happier! I've enjoyed what I have learned so far. I'm excited to build my skills and become a well rounded developer.</p>
